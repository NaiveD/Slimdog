Modifications based on Experiment 1:
1. Body adjustment angles divided by 5. (The adjustment is too small, the fitness results do not change much, alaways around 40, so only did 10 iterations)
2. Initial position of 4 legs set to the same. 

Height of the higgest part of the robot to the ground: 42.5 cm.
Height of the ledder to the ground: 87.5 cm.
